			<td bgcolor="#D3EDF6" width="100%" >The latest Camry, which will be the eighth-generation of the global Camry model,[140] and known as the XV70 was introduced at the January 2017 North American International Auto Show.[139] It was launched in Japan on 10 July 2017 and in Australia on 21 November 2017. It will be launched soon in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia by the end of 2018. It was expected to be launched in Western Europe in 2019, replacing the Avensis.[141] North American production started in June 2017, and sales began in late July 2017.[142] Due to the need to equip Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky with new equipment for Toyota New Global Architecture, a small portion of the initial North American production was sourced from the Tsutsumi plant in Japan. Once TMMK is completely retooled for the new Camry, North American production will come exclusively from TMMK.[citation needed] Australian models are now sourced from Japan as Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant has been closed, marking the end of local Toyota production dating back 55 years.[143] The Camry will be built on Toyota New Global Architecture Platform, which is shared with the latest Toyota Prius hybrid hatchback and Toyota C-HR crossover SUV.Each trim level will feature a different front fascia to differentiate it from other Camry models</td>

			<td bgcolor="#D3EDF6">For 2018, Lexus introduced a 2-row version of the LX to go along with the previously standard 3-row configuration. Aside from the new model, the LX saw no major changes for the 2018 or 2017 model years. That means that a 2016 LX is essentially the same SUV as the 2018 model, but likely much less expensive. The 2016 model saw several important additions. Advanced safety features like a 360-degree camera, forward collision warning, and blind spot monitoring became standard, and an eight-speed automatic replaced the old six-speed transmission. The 2016 LX also added refreshed styling inside and out, along with a new infotainment system.To research other models in this generation, read our reviews of the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Lexus LX.
